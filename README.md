Question-1
Fredo and Array Update

Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all elements of the array to some minimum value x, that is, A[i] = x; 1 < i ≤ N, such that the sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that the sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format:

The first line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A. The second line consists of N space-separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output Format:

The only line of output consists of the value of x.

Input Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≤ A[i] < 1000

Input Array>> 1,2,3,4,5
output >> 5
