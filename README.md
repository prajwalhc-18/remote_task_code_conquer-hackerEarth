Question-1
Fredo and Array Update

Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all elements of the array to some minimum value x, that is, A[i] = x; 1 < i ≤ N, such that the sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that the sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format:

The first line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A. The second line consists of N space-separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output Format:

The only line of output consists of the value of x.

Input Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≤ A[i] < 1000

Input Array>> 1,2,3,4,5
output >> 5

Question-2

Common Factors Counter

Little Shino loves maths. Today her teacher gave her two integers. Shino is now wondering how many integers can divide both the numbers. She is busy with her assignments. Help her to solve the problem.

Input:

The first line of the input file contains two integers, a and b.

Output:

Print the number of common factors of a and b.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
12 18

Output:
6

Explanation:
The common factors of 12 and 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Hence, the output is 6.


Example 2:
Input:
8 12

Output:
4

Explanation:
The common factors of 8 and 12 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Hence, the output is 4.
