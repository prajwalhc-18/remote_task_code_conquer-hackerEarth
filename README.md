Question 1: Fredo and Array Update

Fredo is tasked with updating an array A containing N integers. His objective is to set all elements of the array to a minimum value x (A[i] = x; 1 < i ≤ N) such that the sum of the new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Find the minimum possible value of x.

Input Format:
- The first line consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in array A.
- The second line consists of N space-separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output Format:
- The output is a single line containing the value of x.

Input Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ A[i] < 1000

Example:
```
Input Array: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Output: 5
```

Question 2: Common Factors Counter

Little Shino, a math enthusiast, is given two integers and wants to know how many integers can divide both numbers. Your task is to help her find the number of common factors between a and b.

Input:
- The first line of the input file contains two integers, a and b.

Output:
- Print the number of common factors of a and b.

Examples:
Example 1:
```
Input: 12 18
Output: 6
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Hence, the output is 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 8 12
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 8 and 12 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Hence, the output is 4.
